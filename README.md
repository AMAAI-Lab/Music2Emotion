## Introduction

We present a unified multitask learning framework for Music Emotion Recognition (MER) that integrates categorical and dimensional emotion labels, enabling training across multiple datasets. Our approach combines musical features (key and chords) with MERT embeddings and employs knowledge distillation to enhance generalization. Evaluated on MTG-Jamendo, DEAM, PMEmo, and EmoMusic, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the best-performing model from the MediaEval 2021 competition.
